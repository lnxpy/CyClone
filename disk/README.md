kCyClone is kind of Python-Package-Updater that allows users to create an 
updater-version of their python project and make them
available on their Github.

Although users can update their local cloned repository with their own selves, getting 
stuck in a bunch of files and modules and trying to get out of them can be little bit noisy.
First, you need to clone this repository then, start running into it and fill up your fields.
